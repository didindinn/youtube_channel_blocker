## 2 week review

After using the extension for 2 weeks and blocking frequently recommended channels, Youtube has been recommending videos from other channels. If the content is interesting for me I watch it, I block them otherwise. As a side effect of keeping the recommended page relevant, the youtube algorithm is forced to give me at least new/different content to what I usually watch.
